## Goals

- Very quick note taking (belting 'em out)
- Full text search
- Minimalistic by default with powerful features on demand
- Built for automation
- Editor with vim(-style) keybindings because vim has ruined my ability to use any regular, inferior editor


## Roadmap

- Multiple Themes
- Memo Revisions/History
- Full text for attachments
    - Extract text from PDFs
    - OCR for images
- PDF Viewer
- Mermaid/D2 Diagrams support
- KaTeX support
- Spellchecker
- WYSIWYG-style editor (maybe)
- Runnable Code snippets (where applicable) or display results of code snippet
- Interactive tables (sortable/searchable/etc.)
- Folding of sections
- Import/Archive Web Page (maybe including HTML to Markdown conversion)
- Import Support
- WASM based "plugins" or "automations"
- Offline support
    - Start with read only
    - Cache writes
    - The long term goal is to move to a fully "local-first" model with E2EE without sacrificing abilities a regular API provides
- NVim or filesystem based plugin, so notes can easily be edited using any text editor
